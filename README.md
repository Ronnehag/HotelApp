Booking system made in Win Forms as an individual submission work to learn about working with databases through TSQL, ADO.NET and Entity Framework

The problem handles a CRUD for customers.
A booking system where a customer can book room by selecting amount of people and which dates to find matching rooms.
A booking management system where you can validate a booking (paying invoice), edit a booking and remove a booking.

If a booking is more than 10 days old and the invoice isn't paid, then the booking will automatically be flagged as invalid.
