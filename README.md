# HotelApp

Booking system made in Win Forms as an individual submission work to learn about working with databases through TSQL, ADO.NET and Entity Framework

The application handles a CRUD for customers.
A booking system where a customer can book room by selecting amount of people and which dates to find matching rooms.
A booking management system where you can validate a booking (paying invoice), edit a booking and remove a booking.

If a booking is more than 10 days old and the invoice isn't paid, then the booking will automatically be flagged as invalid and not shown in the booking manager. The booked room for that booking will then be available to book for other customers.
